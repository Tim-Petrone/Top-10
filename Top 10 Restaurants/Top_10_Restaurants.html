<h3>Chuck's Steakhouse</h3>

<p>
  Chuck's first steak house opened in Honolulu in 1959 and introduced America to the concept of the grill and a salad bar in the dining room. Customers loved the informal, high value concept. Chuck's expanded to the mainland in the 1960's and opened here in Danbury in May of 1973.

Chuck's takes great pride in serving only premium quality foods to our valued customers. We offer top choice, hand cut and aged Midwestern grain-fed beef, fancy boneless chicken breast and the freshest seafood and shellfish.

<h3>El Tequila</h3>
<img class="ETlogo" src="tequila.png" width=150px;/>
<p>
  Authentic Mexican cuisine in a spacious and welcoming envirnoment. Try our margaritas or the famous "Cancun" Burrito!
El Tequila is run by a family who has been in the restaurant business for over 40 years. The tacos has been lauded as the best in the United States by a national publication and locals tend to agree. They're Tijuana street style tacos which means the tortillas are on the smaller side but they are packed full with ingredients. Try the al pastor, adobada, and chorizo tacos (among others). Quesadillas, sopes, mulas and other favorites are on offer, too. Plan a little extra time to find parking as there isn't street parking or a big lot at the restaurant.

<h3>NOBU</h3>
<img class="NOBUlogo" src="nobu2.svg" width=150px;/>
<p class="NOBU_p">
  Nobu, the worlds most recognized Japanese restaurant, known for its innovative new style cuisine paired with a hip crowd and celebrity following.
Tokyo-trained Nobu Matsuhisa is one of the only chefs celebrated enough to be recognized by one name: Nobu. For years, his classic sushi bar fare and nouveau Japanese cuisine have attracted the food elite from New York to London, Melbourne to Milan. Worldwide, A-Listers vie for the power tables and here in San Diego is no exception. Every dish, including Black Cod with Miso and Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, is a bold and tasty twist on Japan's mild-mannered sensibilities.

<h3>PF Chang's</h3>
<img class="PFlogo" src="pfchangs.png" width=150px;/>
<p>
  P.F. Chang's offers a casual dining atmosphere to experience authentic Chinese food & Asian Cuisine.
Philip Chiang had a deep-rooted appreciation for everything that food stood for: going to the market, spending time with family, a culture of honor and tradition. Philip’s recipes for the first P.F. Chang’s were simple, yet purposeful. He would say to someone ordering Mongolian Beef, “The green onions are not a garnish, everything on the plate is meant to be eaten.”

<h3>La Casa Argentina</h3>
<img class="CAlogo" src="casa.jpg" width=150px;/>
<p>
  This restaurant has nothing to say. Right in the center, great steaks, beautiful surroundings, nice and helpful staff. For those who want to have fun there is always a live music program in front. For those who want a peaceful romantic evening, they can choose another part of the restaurant where there is peace. I do not have a single reservation and I give this restaurant a star with an asterisk.

<h3>Five Guys</h3>
<img class="FGlogo" src="five.jpg" width=150px;/>
<p>
  Five Guys has been a Washington, DC area favorite since 1986 when Jerry and Janie Murrell offered sage advice to the four young Murrell brothers:"Start a business or go to college.” The business route won and the Murrell family opened a carry-out burger joint in Arlington, Virginia.
Under the guidance of Jerry and Janie, the Murrell family served only hand-formed burgers cooked to perfection on a grill along with fresh-cut fries cooked in pure peanut oil. The little burger joint quickly developed a cult-like following. Press paid attention. Customers voted the burger "#1" in the metro area.
